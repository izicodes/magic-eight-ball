<h1 align="center">Magic Eight Ball Lua Project</h1>

This is a simple Lua project that simulates a Magic Eight Ball. The user asks a yes-or-no question and the Magic Eight Ball responds with one of its pre-set answers. In this project, I am going to create a simple Magic Eight Ball using `if/elseif/else` statements and boolean expressions in the Lua programming langauge.

## How to Run the Program
### Via Cloning/Downloading
1. Install Lua on your computer. You can download Lua from the official website: https://www.lua.org/download.html
2. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
4. Run the program by entering the following command: `lua magic_eight_ball.lua`
5. The program will ask you to enter a yes-or-no question. Type your question and press Enter.
6. The Magic Eight Ball will randomly choose one of its pre-set answers and display it on the screen.
7. To exit the program, simply close the terminal or command prompt window.

## Customising the Answers
If you want to customise the answers of the Magic Eight Ball, you can edit the answers table in the magic_eight_ball.lua file by cloning or downloading the repository. Simply add or remove answers from the table to change the possible responses of the Magic Eight Ball.
